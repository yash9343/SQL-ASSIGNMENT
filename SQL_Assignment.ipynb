        "Answer :\n",

        "In SQL, commands are divided into different categories based on the type of operation they perform on a database. DDL, DML, and DQL are three important categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.DDL (Data Definition Language)\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "DDL commands are used to define, create, modify, or delete the structure of database objects such as tables, databases, views, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Changes the structure (schema) of the database\n",

        "- Operations are permanent\n",

        "- Automatically commits changes\n",

        "Common DDL Commands:\n",
